        <h1>The Logic Gate and Dimensional Sequencing</h1>
        <p>
            First, the logic gate: 0+x=1. I chose this because it’s the dead minimum data for a logic gate I could think of. 0 is OFF, FALSE, or NO. 1 is ON, TRUE, or YES. x is self-referential and contains no other external data. As an equation, it reads: Origin state, plus the existence of ‘x’ equals 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            From this, we will build the universe.
        </p>
        <h2>Starting from Void</h2>
        <p>
            Our initial environment: Absolute void. Not ‘nothing’ because that implies the lack of ‘something’. True and absolute void. Into this void, we place our singular piece of data. The Logic Gate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The logic gate begins its cycle from the origin state. x sees that the gate exists, the gate returns “1”. For our purposes, I’ll use YES, but 1, True, On, or any positive binary term will work. In the void, a YES now exists. There are no other data in the void to give definition to this point. It is all potential points while being none. We have created infinite POTENTIAL and an absolute value of YES. The gate cycles back to zero. The origin state is POTENTIAL, and the gate fires from DIMENSION 0 (d0).
        </p>
        <p>
            To return a new YES, the gate cannot create a new point within POTENTIAL. If it does, the origin state does not change. It must return YES in a new place. Outside of POTENTIAL.
        </p>
        <h2>Building Dimensions</h2>
        <p>
            A second YES appears within the universe, not POTENTIAL, but REAL as it has definition in its relationship to the first point of YES. The moment the second point is created, the FIRST point also becomes real as its relationship to the second point is defined. All points between the two points propagate into REAL points. All points on the axis not contained within the two points have a relationship to the DEFINITE VALUE, but are NO and extend to infinity. We have created an INFINITE LINE and DISTANCE. The FIRST DIMENSION. The gate cycles back to 0. The gate fires again.
        </p>
        <p>
            A third point, not contained within the infinite object, returns a new YES that is separate. Three points exist and all points between them propagate into existence. All points external to the connection now have relational data, but are NO. We have created an INFINITE PLANE and a DEFINITE VALUE of Area. The SECOND DIMENSION (2d). The gate fires again.
        </p>
        <p>
            A fourth point, outside of the infinite plane, is created. We have INFINITE SPACE and DEFINITE VOLUME. The gate fires again.
        </p>
        <h2>Time and Beyond</h2>
        <p>
            To this point, every dimension is comprised of an infinite stack of previous dimensions and is an infinitely thin slice of the next. The new point is outside of SPACE, an infinite stack of the previous dimension. This is a sequence of spatial snapshots. Time. The FOURTH DIMENSION. The gate fires again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where does it fire the new point? Special Relativity states that there are four dimensions: 3 of space and 1 of time. In this thought experiment, we have ONLY space and time. No gravity. No matter. No energy. We must have another dimension, but what? We find our clue in the FIRST DIMENSION. The mathematics are linear for the FIRST and FOURTH dimensions (distance and duration). This is a system built on logic, propagation, and recursion. There are three dimensions of space. Could there be three dimensions of time? 1d is to 4d what 2d is to 5d. What is 5th dimensional time?
        </p>
        <p>
            Your time and mine are different. As you fly on airplanes or drive through valleys below sea level, your center of mass in relation to the Earth’s center of mass changes, and dilation/expansion give your timeline a uniqueness compared to mine. But as we sit here together, our threads overlap. The threads of everyone you know, everyone near you, weave together to form a sheet of time. For all humans across the world, for all things in our universe, a volume of time also exists. Because the gate fires again.
        </p>
        <h2>Dimensional Sets</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1d: Line</li>
            <li>2d: Plane</li>
            <li>3d: Space</li>
            <li>4d: Time (Linear, 1d Time)</li>
            <li>5d: Time (Planar, 2d Time)</li>
            <li>6d: Time (Spatial, 3d Time)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We have a repeating pattern. Two sets of three dimensions each with linear, planar, and spatial components. What then of the next dimension? Each dimension propagates from the previous, but each of the two sets combines to form something new. We have Where and When. We are missing What and How. At 6d, the gate fires again. This one is the most difficult to quantify, but it is also the simplest and easiest to verify.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>7d: Energy (Linear, 1d Energy, Kinetic)</li>
            <li>8d: Energy (Planar, 2d Energy, Orbital)</li>
            <li>9d: Energy (Spatial, 3d Energy, Field)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            And now we have ‘What’. The gate fires again.
        </p>
        <h2>Force and Gravity</h2>
        <p>
            At this point, we know from observation that Gravity is the result of the other three sets. But can we deduce that? We can. We can also, based on the logical recursion in the process, deduce the other two dimensions of Force.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>10d: 1d Force (Linear, 1d Force, Planck Force - This is a gravitational measurement, but I go into the extension of scope at the end)</li>
            <li>11d: Magnetism (Planar, 2d Force, Dipolar)</li>
            <li>12d: Gravity (Spatial, 3d Force, Monopolar)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Just like that, we have a universe.
